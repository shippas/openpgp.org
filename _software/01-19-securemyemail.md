Canary Mail for Mac and iOS implements the OpenPGP standard. Encryption and decryption are handled seamlessly in-app. Users can generate and manage keys via the built-in key manager, as well as search for keys on SKS and Keybase servers. Canary also offers an optional zero-setup encryption mode for users who prefer automatic WhatsApp-like encryption. In addition, Canary offers a full range of powerful productivity features such as read notifications, snooze, follow-up reminders, to-dos, email templates, etc, and works with all popular IMAP and Exchange accounts, including Gmail, iCloud, Outlook, Office365, etc.
